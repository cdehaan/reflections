When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you're working in my places, or on a project with many people.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Someone else might have made a change that you don't want. Also, security reasons.
