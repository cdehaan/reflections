When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you're working in my places, or on a project with many people.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Someone else might have made a change that you don't want. Also, security reasons.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are to copy someone else's stuff so I can use it, all online.
Clones are other times you copy
Brances are different states of the code in one repository
