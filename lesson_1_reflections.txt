How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

It didn't show things that didn't change, so I only saw the little bits that were different.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You can go back to things that worked before

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    You can set milestones that make sense to you
    Google Docs style helps you when you are lost in thought

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Some programs are better thought of as one unit of many files, other things
    like pictures don't connect

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    log tell me what's been happening overall, diff tells me details

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I'll know it's easy to go back, and find mistakes, and undo them

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
